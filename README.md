# 2 A.M.

The 2 A.M. alias is a tribute to the long coding night spend during Jams & hackathons.  
But it stand for "Two Jams, A Month".  

The building block of this project:  
Have the discipline to distribute at least two creative, or helpful,  
projects per months with the following contents:  
a refactored code, some documentations, utility goodies and a review video ;)  

If you have any idea that would worst to be implemented for fun or to be helpful.

## About me

My name is Strée Eloi, I am a digital nomade from Belgium.
The goal in life I try to achived is to amaze myself by coding weird games and applicaitons.     
The current directions I am taking are new technologies, game jams and virtual reality.

My hope is that during my last breath, I would be able to look back at my life, smile and think:
"Holy shit ! What a beautiful ride !"

### For a living
My job objectif is to teach people how be wizard through coding:    
- lessons, conferences, workshop...    
  
To do such, I need lot's of time to experiment and learn on new technologies.    
And it is the reason why I can not accept fulltime jobs.    

But to life you need a fulltime job !    
That the reason of my Patreon:   
_"Share all my codes in exchange of a monthly contribution to my researches"_

More patreons -> Less need of a job    
Less need of a job -> More time for researches     
More time for researches -> More happy patreons ;)   
More happy patreons -> More happy me

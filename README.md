## About me

My name is Strée Eloi, I am a digital nomad from Belgium.    
    
What I try to achieve on my free time ?      
Amaze me by creating unsual games and applicaitons.              
To do that, my current directions are the new technologies, game jams and virtual reality.

My guideline is to be able during my last breath to look back at my life, smile and think:     
"Holy shit! What a beautiful ride !"

## About me

My name is Strée Eloi. 
My goal in life is to amaze myself by coding weird games and applicaitons.
My current direction is new technologies, game jams and virtual reality.

My hope is that during my last breath, I would be able to look back at my life, smile and think:
"Holy shit ! What a beautiful ride !"

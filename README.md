# 2 A.M.

The 2 A.M. alias is a tribute to the long coding night spend during Jams & hackathons.
But it stand for "Two Jams, A Month".

The building block of this project:
Have the discipline to distribute at least two creative, or helpful,
projects per months with the following contents:
a refactored code, some documentations, utility goodies and a review video ;)
